In addition, G2MC uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate the Websites and Services, and these third parties have been selected for their high standards of security, both electronic and physical. For example, G2MC uses <a href="https://www.ovh.com/ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OVH</a> and <a href="http://www.ecritel-cloud.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Écritel</a>, recognized leaders in secure data, for hosting of the Websites and Services, and storage of User data including Personal Information.

<p>(ii)     G2MC shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations under the present TOU where such failure results from any cause beyond G2MC’s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation, or any force majeure event.</p>
<p>(iii)     If any provision of the TOU or Privacy Policy is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties&#8217; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU or Privacy Policy, as the case may be, shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>(iv)     The failure of G2MC to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these TOU does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, which will still be available to G2MC.</p>

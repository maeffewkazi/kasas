                                    Nutella-and-strawberry pizza and homemade ice creams. I am located in the heart of Home Société with a second entrance that opens onto Cartwright Street. I am fresh, unexpected and authentically Italian. I am many things.

<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
<p>This Policy covers the treatment of personally-identifiable information, i.e. any information that identifies an individual, or can be used in conjunction with other information to identify an individual (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”) and other information gathered by G2MC when you are visiting a Website and / or using the Services. This Policy also covers G2MC’s treatment of any Personal Information that G2MC may share with its business partners or other third parties under very limited circumstances.</p>
<p>This Policy does not apply to the general practices and treatment of information (whether Personal or not) by third parties that G2MC does not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites or services that you elect to access through the Websites or via a link from the Websites (“<strong>Third-Party Websites</strong>”), or to individuals that G2MC does not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access or link only to those Third-Party Websites that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Websites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Websites you access. We have named and provided links to the most important of these Third-Party Websites elsewhere in this Policy.</p>
<p>Finally, this Policy does not cover any Personal Information you send to G2MC via any non-secured, non-encrypted mode of communications such as email, instant messenger or other messaging service, or Twitter or any other social media, as communications via these methods may be subject to interception, loss, or alteration. While we welcome your comments and suggestions sent to us in this manner, we encourage you to carefully examine what Personal Information you send to G2MC via these methods.</p>
<h2>No Collection of Personal Information as a Matter of Course</h2>
<p>G2MC does not, as a matter of course, gather any of your Personal Information while you visit the Websites or are using the Services, unless you are asked to provide such information, for example by signing up for an account or making a purchase of Products. Personal Information is only gathered with your informed consent.

<h3>5. Products, Pricing, Taxes and Payment</h3>
<h4>a. Products for Sale through the Services</h4>
<p>We have done our best to display as accurately as possible the colours of the Products shown on the Websites. However, because the colours you see will depend on your monitor or display, we cannot guarantee that your display of any Product colour will be accurate. While the Websites attempt to be accurate in its product descriptions, G2MC does not represent or warrant that Product descriptions or other content on the Websites is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If you find that a Product you purchase is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in accordance with G2MC &#8216;s Return Policy.</p>
<p>The purchase of Products on the Websites is subject to availability. In the event that G2MC advises you that any products are no longer available, G2MC will have no obligation to fulfill your order and you will have no obligation to pay G2MC for the order.</p>
<h4>b. Pricing and Payments</h4>
<p>Prices displayed through the Services are firm and in Canadian dollars, which may be converted to other currencies at the time of payment processing, depending on your country of origin and / or credit card account agreement. Prices do not include applicable sales taxes, delivery fees or any other applicable fees, which shall be displayed during the checkout process, depending on your location and selections you have made (for example delivery method).</p>
<p>By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process by clicking the Place Order button, you agree to pay G2MC the amount set out as the Total in the Order Summary section of the checkout process. The Total is quoted in Canadian dollars and includes shipping and handling fees, any applicable environmental or other additional fees, and all applicable taxes.</p>
<p>While we strive for accuracy in the pricing displayed on the Websites and the other product information we provide, errors can occur. In the event that a Product is mistakenly listed at an incorrect price, G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and the Purchaser&#8217;s credit card or PayPal account charged. If the Purchaser has already been charged for the purchase and the order is cancelled, G2MC shall issue a credit to the credit card or PayPal account used to make the purchase in the amount of the incorrect price (plus any taxes and / or shipping or other fees).</p>
<p>If you have a valid promotional code, it shall be applied and displayed during the checkout process once you enter the code. In the event that an incorrect discount is applied, G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders listed at an incorrect discount. G2MC reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the purchase has been confirmed and the Purchaser’s credit card charged.</p>

The Third-Party Payment Processors currently accept certain credit and debit cards (which shall be displayed to you upon making your payment) as payment options (as well as your PayPal account) but these are subject to change without notice. Once transactions are accepted by a Third-Party Payment Processor, they are processed in accordance with their program rules and procedures and Terms of Use. G2MC and the Third-Party Payment Processors are unaffiliated companies and G2MC has no influence on the operations of the Payment Processors. G2MC and / or its Representatives shall in no way be held responsible for any losses or damages, direct or indirect, pecuniary or otherwise, resulting from any error or failure on the part of the Third-Party Payment Processors.</p>
